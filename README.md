<p align="center">
  <img src="./public/images/frustrated-girl.png" alt="Frustrated Girl" width="500"/>
</p>

Fashion is a powerful form of self-expression, especially for GenZ and those who love to stay ahead of trends. However, this passion comes with its own set of challenges:

- **Decision Fatigue:** Endless hours spent deciding what to wear, trying to match trends or create new looks.
- **Underused Wardrobe:** Clothes bought for a vibe or occasion often end up forgotten and unworn.
- **Overwhelming Choices:** Fast fashion and countless options make it hard to keep track of what you own and how to style it.
- **Lack of Personalization:** Most fashion apps and advice ignore your unique body type, preferences, and actual wardrobe.
